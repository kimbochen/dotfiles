# My Dotfiles

In case my current computer breaks. Includes some dotfiles and package lists.

## Brewfile: Homebrew
Reinstall the packages using the `brew bundle` command.

## nvim: Neovim
The configurations and plugins for my Neovim setup.

## .bashrc: Bash
Some path settings, two functions regarding pip, and some variables.
Might want to switch to Z-shell sometime.
